The default config file for training is "panoptic_deeplab_R_52_os16_mg124_poly_90k_bs32_crop_512_1024_dsconv.yaml".
"demo_joint.yaml" is the setup file for the test (evaluation),
The files starting with "allAdapt" and "volumeAdapt" can be used directly for the training of different variants.
You can also see the training settings in these files (which are consistent with the paper).
