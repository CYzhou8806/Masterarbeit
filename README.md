# Masterarbeit

This work uses detectron2 as the basic framework. 
The main code is in the path "detectron2/projects/Baseline". 

"Environment settings.txt" records the environment configuration used for this job. 

The folders "devkit_semantics", 
"cityscapesScripts-master" 
and "kitti360Scripts" are the scripts that come with the dataset in question.
I have modified them a bit to fit the needs of this work. 
Their processing logic is similar.
